## Who Am I?

My name is Alexander Kadeem and I am a web developer based in Nairobi, Kenya.
For the past few years I have enjoyed a passion and desire for programming and the
freedom it brings to create something from nothing. In future I would like the chance
to work on interesting projects and learn more programming languages. For now however
I have to focus on my main task, building a name for myself and overcoming my currently
present Impostor Syndrome.

## Stuff I've worked on:

- [**The Chuck App**](https://kadeem-online.github.io/React-004-ChuckNorrisApp/) - a simple react app that uses the [the Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to fetch Chuck Norris jokes for it's user. **NOTE**: _NSFW jokes may be fetched._
- [**EcoPure Landing Page**](https://kadeem-online.github.io/DEMO-ecopure-landing-page/) - Landing page featuring GSAP animations for a company that provides organic and natural beauty products for women.
